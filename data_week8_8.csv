"Change is the only constant. In many sectors, a change is being witnessed that is getting increasingly rapid. This carries a plethora of new innovation possibilities with it. This necessitates well-founded data about trends, future developments and their consequences. This study seeks to catch the new directions, paradigms as predictors with an association of each topic which will be discovered through topic modeling techniques like LDA with BoW. For this, empirical analysis on 3269 research articles from the Journal of Applied Intelligence was done, which were gathered during a 30-year span. The inferred topics were then structured into a way suitable for performing predictive analysis. This is significant in the sense that it will help to predict what technology will be encountered in the future, as well as how far human’s ability to innovate and discover things may lead this world to. The final model using TF-IDF scores has outperformed the baseline model by a margin of 41%"
"Topic analysis (also called topic detection, topic modeling, or topic extraction) is a machine learning technique that organizes and understands large collections of text data, by assigning “tags” or categories according to each individual text’s topic or theme. Topic analysis uses natural language processing (NLP) to break down human language into blocks (speech, words, sentences, context) so that you can find patterns and unlock semantic structures within texts to extract insights and help make data-driven decisions. The two most common approaches for topic analysis with machine learning are NLP topic modeling and NLP topic classification. Topic modeling faces several challenges: some are general to the NLP task (as extracting the context of document), and some are specific and are related to the nature (or properties) of the documents. One particular type of documents that raises several challenges are short-text documents that we find in Social Networks. First, we should note that with the growth of online social network platforms and applications, large amounts of textual user-generated content are created daily in the form of comments, reviews, and short-text messages. However, despite their ubiquity, extracting topics from shorts texts remains a difficult task for several reasons. First, unlike traditional normal texts, short texts typically only include a few words. Therefore, directly applying traditional models on short texts will suffer from the severe data sparsity problem (i.e., the sparse word co-occurrence patterns in individual document). Second, the limited contexts make it more difficult to identify the senses of ambiguous words in short texts. Third, in general, the performance of the used machine learning models relies on labeled data. Unfortunately, due to their volume, labeling short-text from social networks remains a tedious and hard task. In this paper, we propose a model for extracting topics in short-texts, and more specifically in Twitter. The key feature of our proposal is the use of word embedding technique for topic modeling, and k-Means clustering for the semi-automatic annotation of tweets. In addition, and unlike most existing approaches, we assign in our model a set of topics to a tweet each with a confidence degree"
"This study employs advanced text-mining techniques to offer an in-depth and comprehensive overview of the extensive body of research on Airbnb. By analyzing 1021 articles published in 416 journals spanning the period from 2015 to 2022, this study aims at revealing Airbnb research topics and trends. The results show that the primary focus of academic inquiry regarding Airbnb revolves around two domains: the company’s operational practices and its impacts on various domains. Within the realm of Airbnb’s operational practices, four distinct research topics emerge as particularly prominent and extensively explored. These encompass the dynamics of ‘trust in Airbnb,’ the formulation and implementation of ‘house rules,’ the mechanisms of governing ‘Airbnb pricing’ strategies, and the critical examination of ‘value creation in Airbnb’ initiatives. Meanwhile, the most researched impacts of Airbnb are on urban tourism, rental housing markets, tourist destinations, and hotels. These spheres have received significant scholarly attention due to the profound implications and transformative effects engendered by Airbnb’s disruptive presence in these areas. Moreover, the findings underscore that research pertaining to Airbnb’s operational aspects has witnessed a significant increase in popularity over time, indicating a marked shift in the focal points of Airbnb research. Notably, the research topics that have experienced substantial growth include ‘trust in Airbnb,’ ‘Airbnb pricing,’ and ‘impacts on tourist destinations.’ Lastly, this study found that Airbnb-related research articles in hospitality and tourism journals tend to be more delving into industry-specific phenomena and challenges. Conversely, non-hospitality and tourism journals provide a broader coverage of topics related to Airbnb, encapsulating diverse areas of inquiry beyond the boundaries of the industry. This literature review provides valuable insights into existing research on Airbnb and highlights several critical areas for future research."
"This study investigated the emergence and use of Twitter, as of July 2023 being rebranded as X, as the main forum for social media communication in parasitology. A dataset of tweets was constructed using a keyword search of Twitter with the search terms ‘malaria’, ‘Plasmodium’, ‘Leishmania’, ‘Trypanosoma’, ‘Toxoplasma’ and ‘Schistosoma’ for the period from 2011 to 2020. Exploratory data analyses of tweet content were conducted, including language, usernames and hashtags. To identify parasitology topics of discussion, keywords and phrases were extracted using KeyBert and biterm topic modelling. The sentiment of tweets was analysed using VADER. The results show that the number of tweets including the keywords increased from 2011 (for malaria) and 2013 (for the others) to 2020, with the highest number of tweets being recorded in 2020. The maximum number of yearly tweets for Plasmodium, Leishmania, Toxoplasma, Trypanosoma and Schistosoma was recorded in 2020 (2804, 2161, 1570, 680 and 360 tweets, respectively). English was the most commonly used language for tweeting, although the percentage varied across the searches. In tweets mentioning Leishmania, only ~37% were in English, with Spanish being more common. Across all the searches, Portuguese was another common language found. Popular tweets on Toxoplasma contained keywords relating to mental health including depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. The Trypanosoma tweets referenced drugs (benznidazole, nifurtimox) and vectors (bugs, triatomines, tsetse), while the Schistosoma tweets referenced areas of biology including pathology, eggs and snails. A wide variety of individuals and organisations were shown to be associated with Twitter activity. Many journals in the parasitology arena regularly tweet about publications from their journal, and professional societies promote activity and events that are important to them. These represent examples of trusted sources of information, often by experts in their fields. Social media activity of influencers, however, who have large numbers of followers, might have little or no training in science. The existence of such tweeters does raise cause for concern to parasitology, as one may start to question the quality of information being disseminated. "
"Approaches for estimating the similarity between individual publications are an area of longstanding interest in the scientometrics and informetrics communities. Traditional techniques have generally relied on references and other metadata, while text mining approaches based on title and abstract text have appeared more frequently in recent years. In principle, topic models have great potential in this domain. But, in practice, they are often difficult to employ successfully, and are notoriously inconsistent as latent space dimension grows. In this manuscript we identify the three properties all usable topic models should have: robustness, descriptive power and reflection of reality. We develop a novel method for evaluating the robustness of topic models and suggest a metric to assess and benchmark descriptive power as number of topics scale. Employing that procedure, we find that the neural-network-based paragraph embedding approach seems capable of providing statistically robust estimates of the document–document similarities, even for topic spaces far larger than what is usually considered prudent for the most common topic model approaches"
"Purely quantitative or qualitative studies of perceived comfort and safety have different strengths and limitations related to scope, reliability, and generalizability. To pursue new insights about perceptions of pedestrian comfort and safety, this study uses the novel approach of Structural Topic Modeling to organize open-response comments into prominent topics, or themes, and explore the factors affecting the prevalence and content of topics. The study data come from a survey in which participants rated short video clips of pedestrians interacting with motor vehicles or bicycles at unsignalized crosswalks, and then provided optional open-response comments about each video. Modeling results identified six topics in the text data: (1) driver behaviour and pedestrian risk, (2) pedestrian risk assessment and mitigation, (3) pedestrians not waiting before crossing, (4) cyclists leaving the bicycle lane, (5) cyclists’ yielding necessity, and (6) and cyclists’ speed modifications. The prevalence of the topics was significantly affected by attributes of the interaction (vehicle type—bicycle or car—and its proximity), and attributes of the perceiver (travel habits and self-reported risk aversion). Topic prevalence was unrelated to participants’ comfort and safety ratings for the same interactions, indicating that topic modeling provides a fundamentally different source of information than quantitative severity ratings. The findings help to illuminate why pedestrian-cyclist interactions may attract disproportionate attention from the travelling public, despite their relatively lower risk than interactions with motor vehicle drivers.

"Efficient topic modeling is needed to support applications that aim at identifying main themes from a collection of documents. In the present paper, a reduced vector embedding representation and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are combined to develop a topic modeling strategy that is able to identify representative themes from a large collection of documents. Documents are encoded using a reduced, contextual vector embedding from a general-purpose pre-trained language model (sBERT). A modified PSO algorithm (pPSO) that tracks particle fitness on a dimension-by-dimension basis is then applied to these embeddings to create clusters of related documents. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on two datasets. The first dataset consists of posts from the online health forum r/Cancer and the second dataset is a standard benchmark for topic modeling which consists of a collection of messages posted to 20 different news groups. When compared to the state-of-the-art generative document models (i.e., ETM and NVDM), pPSO is able to produce interpretable clusters. The results indicate that pPSO is able to capture both common topics as well as emergent topics. Moreover, the topic coherence of pPSO is comparable to that of ETM and its topic diversity is comparable to NVDM. The assignment parity of pPSO on a document completion task exceeded 90% for the 20NewsGroups dataset. This rate drops to approximately 30% when pPSO is applied to the same Skip-Gram embedding derived from a limited, corpus-specific vocabulary which is used by ETM and NVDM."
"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has indisputably impacted every aspect of human life, and a host of studies have investigated its different aspects. This paper models the contents of Persian literature on COVID-19. Method: This is a descriptive-exploratory study in which 815 articles were collected from the Magiran database. The articles were published before March 2022. The abstracts and titles were used in the modeling. The modeling was performed by combining the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm with ParsBERT. Findings: Topic modeling indicated ten major topics, including medicine, psychology, humanities, politics, management, biology, economics, culture, engineering, and religion. The articles under the category of medicine had the largest cluster (42.3%), while engineering and religion had the smallest clusters (1.1% each). Conclusion: The found topics in the created clusters have structural relationships. The COVID-19 effect on physical and mental health (medical and psychological topics) is the most crucial factor. These clusters provide evidence that COVID-19 affects all facets of human society at three levels: the individual, family, and society. Aside from the ten critical clusters in the humanities field, the utmost disorder is related to teaching and learning. For the first time, this research has presented a model of scientific communication in the field of COVID-19 based on the data collected from a Persian database – Magiran. "
"We used structural topic modeling to analyze over 800,000 German tweets about COVID-19 to answer the questions: What patterns emerge in tweets as a response to a health crisis? And how do topics discussed change over time? The study leans on the goals associated with the health information seeking (GAINS) model, discerning whether a post aims at tackling and eliminating the problem (i.e., problem-focused) or managing the emotions (i.e., emotion-focused); whether it strives to maximize positive outcomes (promotion focus) or to minimize negative outcomes (prevention focus). The findings indicate four clusters salient in public reactions: 1) “Understanding” (problem-promotion); 2) “Action planning” (problem-prevention); 3) “Hope” (emotion promotion) and 4) “Reassurance” (emotion-prevention). Public communication is volatile over time, and a shift is evidenced from self-centered to community-centered topics within 4.5 weeks. Our study illustrates social media text mining’s potential to quickly and efficiently extract public opinions and reactions. Monitoring fears and trending topics enable policymakers to rapidly respond to deviant behavior, like resistive attitudes toward containment measures or deteriorating physical health. Healthcare workers can use the insights to provide mental health services for battling anxiety or extensive loneliness from staying home."
"Nowadays, Climate change is an important environmental factor that affects every living thing on the earth. It is very essential to study the public perceptions regarding the disaster events frequently happening due to climate change. today's digital era individuals are using social network platforms namely Twitter, Facebook, and Weibo now and then to express their views about any events. In this paper, the climate change Twitter data set was considered for analyzin the topics and the opinions discussed by the public regarding climate change. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA method was used to list out the various topics present in the data set and the Bidirectional Encoder Representatio from Transformers(BERT uncased) is an efficient deep learning technique used to classify the sentiments present the data set. Here the sentiments were labelled as pro news, support, neutral and anti. The performance of the propose topic modelling and sentiment classification model was compared using the precision, recall, and accuracy measure The BERT uncased model with has shown the best results such as precision of 91.35%, recall of 89.65%, and accurac of 93.50% compared to other methods."
"Topic modeling is an active research area with several unanswered questions. The focus of recent research in this area is on the use of a vector embedding representation of the input text with both generative and evolutionary topic modeling techniques. Unfortunately, it is hard to compare different techniques when the underlying data and preprocessing steps that were used to develop the models are not available. This paper presents two secondary datasets that can help address this gap. These datasets are derived from two primary datasets. The first consists of 8145 posts from the r/Cancer health forum and the second consists of 18,294 messages submitted to 20 different newsgroups. The same preprocessing procedure is applied to both datasets by removing punctuation, stop words and high-frequency words. Each dataset is then clustered using three different topic modeling techniques: pPSO, ETM and NVDM and three topic numbers: 10,20, 30. In addition, for pPSO two text embedding representations are considered: sBERT and Skipgram. The secondary datasets were originally developed in support of a comparative analysis of the aforementioned topic modeling techniques in a study titled “Comparing PSO based Clustering over Contextual Vector Embeddings to Modern Topic Modeling” submitted to the Journal of Information Processing"
"There is a vast amount of academic research on industry decarbonization in the cement and steel industries, but a systematic mapping of the relevant literature is missing to date. Filling this gap, we analyze the directions of innovation in the field by (1) creating data sets containing academic literature on industry decarbonization, by (2) structuring the identified articles topically using a topic modeling approach, and by (3) quantifying the publication volume by the underlying decarbonization option over time. Results show that research on cement and steel production has long focused on efficiency improvements and has only recently shifted toward solutions that allow for the industries’ deep decarbonization. While research on the latter still has to translate into measurable deployment of clean production technologies, trends in the energy consumption and emission intensity of the production processes point toward a positive but stagnating effect of past efficiency-focused research."
"Recent literature on taxation suggests that a “service and client” approach by the authorities is required in order to establish a synergistic tax climate between taxpayers and tax offices and thus enhance voluntary tax compliance. The present study investigates whether lay people’s conceptions about taxation reflect such a synergistic (vs. an antagonistic) climate. Applying an unsupervised machine learning approach (i.e., topic modeling) to over a million tax related tweets from 2010 to 2020, we identified 30 topics with different content. Using the theoretical framework differentiating between synergistic and antagonistic tax climate, we were able to further categorize these topics into four broader groups: 1. Opinions about Tax Politics, 2. Enforcement (antagonistic climate), 3. Information & Service (synergistic climate), and 4. Emotions. The most frequently observed group was Information & Service (synergistic climate), which also steadily gained prominence during the past decade. We proceeded by analyzing the information diffusion properties and sentiment of the tweets associated with the four groups. Information & Service tweets had the most positive sentiment but were shared the least, while tweets regarding Opinions about Tax Politics were shared most often. In sum, the results suggest that lay people’s conceptions about taxation – as discerned from conversations on social media (Twitter) – largely reflect a synergistic (vs. an antagonistic) climate, and contribute to the literature on tax climate and social media."
"Gathering information about cyber threats from various sources can help organisations improve proactive cyber defense and mitigate potential cyber attacks. Recently, Twitter has shown to be beneficial in providing timely Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) concerning cyber threats, software vulnerabilities and exploits. However, manually identifying and investigating useful insights, patterns, and trends from abundant unstructured tweets is difficult. This work proposes an end-to-end data-driven framework to collect, analyze, and monitor tweets using unsupervised topic modeling techniques. A novel visualization technique is also proposed to monitor the dynamic topic trends over time, offering an interpretable way to gain insights into a topic’s lifecycle. A case study is conducted on the Log4shell vulnerability incident to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework. Experiments are carried out on a real-world Twitter dataset collected from 47 users within the CTI community. Results indicate that the proposed framework can discover emerging topics relevant to real-world cybersecurity incidents, with Log4Shell-related topics identified before the common public disclosure date by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). This framework can expedite the data processing workflow and visualization for cyber threat analysis, enabling organizations to identify trends and patterns that can potentially indicate a security breach or attack."
"Topic modelling is a probabilistic based statistical model used to find the latent topics that best depicts the content of the documents. Community Question Answering websites such as Quora, Stack Overflow and Yahoo! Answers have been prevalently in use, performs topic modeling as lot ofqueries pour in on daily basis which make it challenging to understand, summarize and synthesize the main topic of discussions. On these websites there are basically two sources of information that are available to analyze the key latent topics: questions text and tags. Questions are in textual format and tags are the keywords or tokens that are related to the question being asked which describes the content of the question. In past studies, most of the researchers have used question text for the purpose of topic modeling. It is still unclear why tag is not being considered for topic modeling. To combat this issue, this paper performs topic modeling using both question tags and text. The topic modeling based on tags has been compared with text based on two metrics namely coherence and perplexity. Experiment has been conducted on three real time datasets namely Artificial intelligence, Software Engineering and quantum computing from Stack exchange website. At high level tag-based topic modelling looked promising but closer observation revealed the opposite. It has been found that topic modeling using question text is preferable as topic modelling using tags collapses after a certain number of topics."
